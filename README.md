## How to run

- `npm run setup`
  - This will install all the necessary packages and libraries needed for this assignment
- `npm start`
  - This will start the nodejs server
- Open `localhost:3000` on your browser

## For development

- `npm run setup`
  - This will install all the necessary packages and libraries needed for this assignment
- `npm run dev`
  - This will run the web application in your browser and any changes you make would be visible immediately (no need to reload the browser)

## Common issues

- When you run `npm run dev` it would open up the browser automatically.
  - In case the browser does not open, manually open `http://localhost:7000/`
  - In case the browser opens but the page does not show anything (you can see the page loading) refresh your page.
